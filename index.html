                                The field of robotic manipulation is undergoing rapid transformation with the integration of high-performance control systems, lightweight actuators, and intelligent vision-based perception. Autonomous robotic manipulators that can see, think, and act independently are becoming foundational technologies across numerous industries—including logistics, manufacturing, service robotics, and medical applications.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At North Carolina State University, our student-led research team has developed a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm using stepper motors and a DC-motor-powered gripper. We are actively designing and implementing a high-level controller to autonomously complete tasks such as object detection, grasping, and relocation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To overcome current limitations, we propose transitioning to brushless DC (BLDC) motors paired with Field-Oriented Control (FOC) drivers. We also plan to integrate a Luxonis OAK-4 S camera for AI-enabled RGB-D vision and real-time object detection.

                                As part of the Wolf Mini robotics project, I focused on the 
                                mechanical design and development of custom high-torque actuators 
                                for a compact quadruped platform. Specifically, I designed 
                                brushless cycloidal-drive actuators with a 1:35 reduction 
                                ratio—chosen for their high torque density, shock resistance, and 
                                backdrivability, all critical for agile legged locomotion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The actuators were tailored for the Wolf Mini's size and 
                                performance needs, balancing compactness with power output to 
                                enable dynamic motion while maintaining structural efficiency. 
                                This involved iterative CAD modeling, torque analysis, and 
                                integrating the actuator system with the robot’s mechanical and 
                                control architecture. This work laid the foundation for robust 
                                joint actuation in the prototype and set the stage for future 
                                enhancements in mobility and control.

                                As Founder and President of the Re-Battery Recycling Program, I launched a youth-led sustainability initiative in December 2021 to address the growing issue of battery waste through safe collection, repurposing, and education. I led the design and manufacturing of custom battery recycling bins and organized a team to distribute them in schools and communities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Supported by America’s Promise Alliance, the Mott Foundation, and in partnership with Love A Sea Turtle (LAST), we’ve installed bins at six high schools in Pitt County and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM), with recognition from the Pitt County Board of Commissioners. Together with LAST, we also engage peers in awareness campaigns and outreach efforts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To date, the program has repurposed over 14,000 used batteries, offering an accessible and scalable solution for responsible battery disposal. We’ve completed a new, safer bin design and are now preparing installations at NC State University and additional campuses across North Carolina.

                                Plant Helper addresses the common challenge of keeping plants healthy by combining smart sensor technology with eco-friendly design. The device uses FDR sensor technology to accurately measure soil moisture levels and displays real-time plant health information on an intuitive screen. What makes it unique is its integrated approach—beyond monitoring, it plays growth-enhancing 2000Hz frequencies and classical music that scientific studies show can promote plant growth. The entire system is powered by integrated solar panels, making it completely sustainable and maintenance-free.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The device features a comprehensive plant database with species-specific care requirements, mobile app integration for remote monitoring, and personalized plant profiles tracking name, age, and type. This innovative combination of IoT monitoring, audio therapy, and sustainable power earned recognition in Samsung Display's 2020 competition in South Korea, where it won $2700. Plant Helper makes plant care accessible to everyone by providing clear, actionable information that helps both beginners and experienced gardeners grow healthier plants.
