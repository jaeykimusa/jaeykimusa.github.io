                                The full-body trajectory optimization refines motion plans using the robot's complete dynamics, joint limits, and contact constraints. It incorporates contact timings computed from the reduced-order SRB model and solves for detailed joint trajectories and ground reaction forces. By employing a variable-frequency horizon—allocating more resolution to critical motion phases—the method achieves higher-quality motion planning with less computational load. This approach reduced the solving time by an average of 39.8% across multiple jump types, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability for dynamic quadruped behaviors.                            </p>

                                The field of robotic manipulation is rapidly advancing through the integration of high-performance control systems, lightweight actuators, and intelligent vision-based perception. Autonomous robotic manipulators that can see, think, and act are becoming foundational across industries such as logistics, manufacturing, service robotics, and healthcare.

                                At North Carolina State University, our student-led research team is developing a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm powered by stepper motors with gearboxes for joint actuation and a servo motor-driven gripper for precise object handling. The system architecture is built around Arduino-based controllers and motor drivers, enabling modular and accessible development of control logic and motion planning.

                                To enhance autonomy and perception, we are integrating a Luxonis OAK-4 S RGB-D camera for real-time, AI-powered object detection and spatial awareness. This will support tasks such as dynamic object grasping and placement, advancing the arm’s ability to operate in unstructured environments.

                                Contact timing optimization determines the optimal moments for a robot to initiate and break ground contact during dynamic maneuvers like jumping. In this work, a reduced-order model based on single rigid body (SRB) dynamics was used to solve for phase durations and center-of-mass trajectories. These results inform a full-body trajectory optimization, enabling efficient generation of physically consistent motions while significantly reducing computational cost.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This approach is essential for adaptive contact planning, allowing the robot to adjust its contact sequences in response to task demands and environmental changes. By optimizing contact timing instead of relying on fixed schedules, the robot achieves more robust, stable, and versatile behaviors—key for executing agile motions in complex, real-world settings.

                                We are already taking steps to develop a quadruped robot designed to serve as a mobile platform for our robotic manipulator—enabling the arm to operate freely in real-world environments. This integrated system expands the manipulator's application by combining mobility with precision interaction, allowing for complex, autonomous tasks in dynamic and unstructured settings.

                            <p>
                                As part of the Wolf Mini robotics project, I focused on the mechanical design and development of custom high-torque actuators for this compact quadruped platform. Specifically, I designed brushless cycloidal-drive actuators with a 1:35 reduction ratio, chosen for their high torque density, shock resistance, and backdrivability—key traits for agile legged locomotion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The actuators were carefully tailored to match Wolf Mini’s size and performance needs, balancing compactness and power output to support dynamic motion while ensuring mechanical efficiency. This process involved iterative CAD modeling, torque analysis, and seamless integration of the actuators within the robot’s structural and control systems. The work provides a strong foundation for reliable joint actuation and sets the stage for future mobility and manipulator-arm integration.

                                As Founder and President of the Re-Battery Recycling Program, I launched a youth-led sustainability initiative in December 2021 to address the growing issue of battery waste through safe collection, repurposing, and education. I led the design and manufacturing of custom battery recycling bins and organized a team to distribute them in schools and communities.

                                Supported by America’s Promise Alliance, the Mott Foundation, and in partnership with Love A Sea Turtle (LAST), we’ve installed bins at six high schools in Pitt County and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM), with recognition from the Pitt County Board of Commissioners. Together with LAST, we also engage peers in awareness campaigns and outreach efforts.

                                Plant Helper addresses the common challenge of keeping plants healthy by combining smart sensor technology with eco-friendly design. The device uses FDR sensor technology to accurately measure soil moisture levels and displays real-time plant health information on an intuitive screen. What makes it unique is its integrated approach—beyond monitoring, it plays growth-enhancing 2000Hz frequencies and classical music that scientific studies show can promote plant growth. The entire system is powered by integrated solar panels, making it completely sustainable and maintenance-free.
