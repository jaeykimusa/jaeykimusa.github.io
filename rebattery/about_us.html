                Welcome to Re-Battery Recycling Program: <br>
                We are the Re-Battery team, a collaborative initiative based in North Carolina, dedicated to promoting sustainable practices through battery recycling. Our mission is to establish a comprehensive recycling system by installing re-battery recycling bins across the university campus. These bins provide a convenient drop-off point for used batteries, which we collect and either repurpose or send to specialized recycling facilities.

                Our Journey: <br>
                Our initiative began with a strong foundation in the local community and has grown to encompass various educational institutions. We started our efforts in Pitt County Schools and are now expanding our reach within NC State University and beyond. Our team is led by dedicated project leaders and supported by highly involved members who are passionate about environmental sustainability.
