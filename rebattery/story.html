                    Our story
                </strong> <br>
                At the heart of our Re-Battery Recycling Program is a deep love for the environment and a commitment to cherishing our planet. As a student-led initiative, our journey began in high school with a simple yet powerful idea: to make a difference by reducing waste and promoting sustainability. Today, we continue this mission as college students, driven by a passion to protect our planet for future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    The Beginning
                </strong> <br>
                It all started when we realized the alarming number of batteries being discarded into landfills without being recycled. These batteries contain hazardous and toxic components that pose significant threats to the environment. Moved by this discovery, we took action. We built and painted battery collectors for our school, marking the beginning of our recycling program.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Expansion and Recognition
                </strong> <br>
                Our initiative quickly grew, expanding to five other schools in our local county. We shared our story with others to raise awareness about the importance of battery recycling. Our efforts were recognized with prestigious awards, including the America’s Promise Alliance Power of Youth Award with project funds by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation and the Service Volunteer Award by Love A Sea Turtle (LAST). Our work was also acknowledged by Alice Keene at the Pitt County Board of Commissioners for the Governor's Award for Volunteer Service under LAST, alongside other initiatives.
                <br>
                The founder, Jaey, received the President's Volunteer Service Award (Bronze) for his tireless efforts in promoting battery recycling. These recognitions not only validated our mission but also motivated us to continue striving for a more sustainable future.

                <strong>
                    Why It Matters
                </strong> <br>
                Batteries contain toxic materials like lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can contaminate soil and water if not disposed of properly. By recycling these batteries, we help prevent environmental pollution and conserve natural resources. Our research has deepened our understanding of the scientific importance of responsible battery disposal, further fueling our commitment to this cause.

                <strong>
                    A Growing Movement
                </strong> <br>
                While our initiative began with students, it is not limited to them. We envision a diverse team of individuals from all walks of life working together to advance environmental sustainability. We believe that collective action can lead to significant positive change, and we invite everyone to join us in this journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Looking Forward
                </strong> <br>
                As we continue to grow and expand our program, we remain committed to our core mission: to protect our planet through sustainable practices. Our goal is to establish a comprehensive recycling system that inspires other communities to adopt similar initiatives. Together, we can create a cleaner, greener world for generations to come.
