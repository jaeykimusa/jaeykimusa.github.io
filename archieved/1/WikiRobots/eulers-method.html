                <h1>Euler's Method</h1>
                <p>Euler's Methos is one of the simplest and most fundamental numerical techniques used to approximate solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is particularly useful when an analytical solution is difficult or impossible to obtain.</p>
                
                <p>What is Euler's Method? Euler's Method is an iterative procedure that uses the slope of the solution curve (given by the differential equation) to approximate the value of the solution at discrete points. It is based on the idea of linear approximation—using small steps to follow the direction of the slope.</p>

                <h3>Euler integration method for solving differential equations</h3>
                <p>In mathematics there are several types of ordinary differential equations (ODE), like linear, separable, or exact differential equations, which are solved analytically, giving an exact solution. This means that there is a specific method to be applied in order to extract a general exact solution.</p>
                <p>For example: 
                    <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
                        <mfrac>
                          <mrow>
                            <mi>d</mi>
                            <mi>y</mi>
                          </mrow>
                          <mrow>
                            <mi>d</mi>
                            <mi>x</mi>
                          </mrow>
                        </mfrac>

                        <mi>x</mi>

                </p>
                <p>is a first order separable differential equation, which has the exact solution:</p>

                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">

                    </msub>
                    <mo>)</mo>
                    <mo>=</mo>
                    <mfrac>
                        <msup>
                          <mi>x</mi>
                          <mn>2</mn>
                        </msup>
                        <mrow>
                          <mi>2</mi>
                        </mrow>
                    </mfrac>
                    <mo>+</mo>
                    <mi>C</mi>
                </math>

                <p>where C is a constant.</p>

                <p>In practice, most of the differential equation do not hae a standard form and can not be solved with analytic methods, which means we can not find a general solution y(x). This is the case for most of the differential equations derived from physical models (mechanical, electrical, thermal, etc.).</p>


                <p>in this case, we need to use numerical methods to be able to determine the solution of the differential equation. Bear in mind that with numerical methods:</p>
               
   
                    <li>we get an approximation of the solution, not the exact solution</li>
                    <li>the solution is calculated incrementally, step by step</li>        
  
                
                <p>One of the simplest integration method is the Euler integration method, named after the mathematician Leonhard Euler. The Euler method is a first-order method, which means that the local error (error per step) is proportional to the square of the step size, and the global error (error at a given time) is proportional to the step size.</p>
                
                <p>The Euler integration method is also an explicit integration method, which means that the state of a system at a later time (next step) is calculated from the state of the system at the current time (current step).</p>

                    <mo>)</mo>
                    <mo>=</mo>

                    <mo>)</mo>
                </math>

                <p>The Euler integration method is also called the polygonal integration method, because it approximates the solution of a differential equation with a series of connected lines (polygon).</p>
                
                <h3>Line equation</h3>

                <p>In order to have better understanding of the Euler integration method, we need to recall the equation of a line:</p>
