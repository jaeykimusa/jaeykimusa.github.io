                Welcome to Re-Battery Recycling Program: <br>
                We are the Re-Battery team, a diverse group of individuals from across North Carolina, united by a shared commitment to environmental sustainability. Everything from scratch, our mission is to implement a comprehensive battery recycling program, starting in the Triangle area and expanding to broader rural regions. We began our initiative at Pitt County Schools and are now expanding to various institutions, with dedicated project leaders and members at each location.
                <!-- We are the Re-Battery team, a collaborative initiative based in North Carolina, dedicated to promoting sustainable practices through battery recycling. Our mission is to establish a comprehensive recycling system by installing re-battery recycling bins across the university campus. These bins provide a convenient drop-off point for used batteries, which we collect and either repurpose or send to specialized recycling facilities. -->
