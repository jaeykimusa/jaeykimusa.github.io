                Abstract—Improper disposal of batteries poses significant environmental risks, including water pollution, air contamination, and soil degradation, due to the release of toxic substances like lead and lithium. Despite the alarming environmental impact, the recycling rate for many battery types remains low in the U.S., highlighting the urgent need for effective recycling practices. Our Re-Battery Recycling Project aims to address this issue by promoting awareness and implementing accessible recycling solutions, starting with NC State University, to reduce environmental harm and foster a sustainable future.

            <p>
                The environmental impact of improper battery disposal is a pressing concern. Batteries, particularly lead-acid and lithium-ion, contain hazardous materials that can contaminate soil and water if not disposed of correctly[1][2]. This can lead to serious health risks for humans and wildlife. For instance, lead from lead-acid batteries can leach into groundwater, posing significant health hazards, while lithium-ion batteries can cause fires if not handled properly, contributing to air pollution and potential respiratory issues.
            </p>

            <p>
                The recycling challenges for different battery types vary significantly. While lead batteries have a high recycling rate of 99% in the U.S., other types like lithium-ion batteries face significant challenges in recycling due to their complex composition. The U.S. lithium-ion battery recycling market is growing but still faces challenges in scaling up recycling efforts. This disparity in recycling rates emphasizes the need for improved recycling technologies and practices, especially for lithium-ion batteries.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recycling batteries is crucial for environmental sustainability. It reduces the need for mining virgin materials, which can decrease greenhouse gas emissions by up to 81%, water usage by up to 88%, and energy consumption by up to 89%. Proper recycling helps conserve resources and mitigate environmental pollution, making it a crucial step towards sustainability. By promoting effective recycling practices, we can significantly reduce the environmental footprint of battery production and disposal.
