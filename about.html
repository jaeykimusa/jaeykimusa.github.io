                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a passionate Mechanical Engineering student at North Carolina State University with minors in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. My journey combines the precision of engineering with the innovation of technology and the vision of entrepreneurship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What drives me is the intersection of robotics, sustainability, and real-world problem solving. I believe that the future of engineering lies in creating intelligent systems that not only perform efficiently but also contribute to a more sustainable world.
                </p>

                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    My fascination with robotics began early, but it was during my time at NC State that I discovered how mechanical engineering principles could be enhanced with computer science and entrepreneurial thinking. This interdisciplinary approach has shaped my perspective on creating solutions that matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through hands-on research projects, particularly in robotic manipulation and locomotion systems, I've learned that the best engineering solutions come from understanding both the technical challenges and the broader impact on society and the environment.

                <h2>Beyond Engineering</h2>
                <p>
                    When I'm not working on robotics projects or studying, you'll find me exploring new technologies, learning about sustainable design practices, or brainstorming innovative solutions to everyday problems. I believe that the best engineers are also curious about the world around them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm always excited to connect with fellow engineers, researchers, and innovators who share a passion for creating technology that makes a positive difference in the world.
                </p>
